# recommended-reading
A place to store articles etc that I have found to be important and useful.

# General Software Development References
*SourceMaking* - https://sourcemaking.com/
An online reference covering several important books. It has a summary of Martin Fowler's Refactoring (Code Smells, Refactorings etc) and the Gang Of Four's Design Patterns. It also has a simple UML reference.

# General Software Development Articles
*Nine Antipatterns* - http://sahandsaba.com/nine-anti-patterns-every-programmer-should-be-aware-of-with-examples.html
Covers a few important look-outs. This is not code anti-patterns per-se but more on the human side (eg Pre-Optimization).

# Distributed Computing
*Aphyr Jepsen Series* - https://aphyr.com/tags/jepsen
These articles are tremendously useful for understanding how different technologies deal with network partitions. I would keep this close by if you're clustering any datastore etc.
